# AnIssueTrackingSystem
> In this project, we will develop an Angular application for managing and tracking issues using reactive forms and Clarity.
## My application will have several key features:
+ A list of issues displayed in a table that can be sorted and filtered.
+ A form for users to report new issues.
+ A modal dialog for resolving an issue.
## The process for creating this application will involve the following steps:
+ Setting up the project: We will start by creating a new Angular project and installing the necessary packages, such as Clarity, for my application.
+ Creating the issue list: We will create a component to display a list of issues in a table that can be sorted and filtered.
+ Creating the report issue form: We will create a form for users to report new issues, using reactive forms for validation and handling user input.
+ Creating the resolve issue modal: We will create a modal dialog for resolving an issue, which will allow users to update the status of an issue and add comments.
+ Testing and deployment: Once the application is complete, we will test it thoroughly and then deploy it to a production environmen
